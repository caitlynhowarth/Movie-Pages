         <h2>To All The Boys I've Loved Before: P.S. I Still Love You</h2>
     </article>
     <div>
         <p> The sequel, the ludicrously titled To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before: P.S. I Still Love You, arrived on Thursday, nearly two years after the release of the first film, and it picks up shortly after that film’s ending. Lara Jean (Lana Condor, still bringing the same early Meg Ryan-esque energy) is officially dating Peter (Noah Centineo, still mumbly, still bright-eyed) and is understandably anxious about what’s expected of her in her first-ever relationship. To complicate matters, the character from the post-credits sequence of the first film, John Ambrose (Jordan Fisher), one of the recipients of Lara Jean’s love letters, shows up at a fancy old folks’ home where Lara Jean is volunteering. Hi-jinks, romantic complications, and teenage confusion ensue.

        The sequel is, for the most part, a perfectly decent successor to the original. It’s less of a graduation from that film than a continuation; it introduces a few new plot elements but it’s generally more of the same. While it digs a little further into the characters, it seems to do so by necessity, as though the makers realised this is what you need to do to fill out a sequel, rather than what they needed to do because this story had to be told.

        If you liked the original, and you’re invested in it, particularly in the character of Lara Jean, then it’s hard to believe you wouldn’t be invested in this one. That’s thanks largely to Lana Condor, who remains a sparkling, thoughtful presence throughout. It would be so easy for her character to become a blank slate for audiences to project themselves onto, but Condor injects Lara Jean with enough specificity, be it her occasional bashfulness or her classic teenage cruel streak, to stay compelling.
