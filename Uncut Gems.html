         <h2>Uncut Gems</h2>

         <p> Sandler’s superb performance shows how Howard has what amounts to a superpower – his optimism, his toxic gift of the gab, his deranged delusional cheerfulness and his refusal to be fazed or scared by things that would reduce ordinary people to jelly. There’s an incredible sequence on the streets of Manhattan – which the Safdies and their cinematographer Darius Khondji shoot with rangy, loose-limbed exuberance – showing Howard getting punched in the throat by one of his debt collectors and then, after a moment of traumatic wheezing, he goes on walking, talking, attempting to bamboozle his assailant with ersatz charm.

        But Howard is robbing Peter to pay Paul, in such a way that Peter and Paul are eventually going to take turns holding him down while the other beats the daylight out of him. His whole life is a pyramid scheme of dishonesty, in which the victim is himself.

        And all the time the film is in a state of deafening cacophonous uproar: the white noise in poor Howard’s head is displaced into the streets, the clubs, the sports arenas where his terrible humiliation is to be played out. It’s a cinema of pure energy and grungy voltage, and the Safdies make it look very easy. This will be the year’s most exciting film. You can take that to the bank.
